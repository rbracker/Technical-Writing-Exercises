# Asciidoc-sample

## Documentation Practice

Welcome to the Technical Writing Exercise! This project is designed for practicing technical writing using various documentation formats, including AsciiDoc, Markdown, and reStructuredText.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create documentation for a simple process: Making a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich. The goal is to explore and compare the syntax and features of different markup languages commonly used in technical writing.

1. AsciiDoc

   * AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language that allows for easy conversion to different output formats.
  
2. Markdown

   * Markdown is a widely-used markup language known for its simplicity and readability.

3. reStructuredText

    * reStructuredText (reST) is a lightweight markup language designed to create readable and simple plaintext documents that can be converted to other formats, such as HTML, PDF, and more. It is often used for technical documentation, including Python documentation, Sphinx documentation, and various other projects.
